## About Me

I am a postdoc researcher in <a target="_blank" href="https://iol.zib.de/"><autocolor>IOL</autocolor></a> group at Zuse-Institut Berlin. I got my Ph.D. at Laboratoire d'informatique de l'École Polytechnique (LIX), where I was part of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/optimix/"><autocolor>Optimix</autocolor></a>.


## Research Areas

My work leverages mathematical tools from optimization theory, including lifting techniques, decomposition methods, and cutting-plane methods. These tools enable the design of reliable algorithms for hard optimization problems arising in combinatorics, operations research, and quantum physics.

Beyond theory, I am passionate about translating fundamental advances into practice—developing algorithms that can tackle challenging real-world problems while remaining reproducible and accessible. This motivation naturally connects my research to the development of robust optimization software systems, most notably through my contributions to the open source MILP solver: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scipopt.org/"><autocolor>SCIP</autocolor></a>. 

I primarily work in C++ and Julia. Source codes for my research are usually available in my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lidingxu?tab=repositories"><autocolor>GitHub repositories</autocolor></a>.
